						<h2>Thank you for clickling on our ad, but we are not selling a perfume</h2>

				  <p>You have seen this ad on Facebook as part of a scientific research study conducted at LMU Munich, Germany. In this study, we are investigating how people react to personalisation and explanations about this personalisation. Personalisation in general means that content is tailored to the individual user, that is, every user sees for example different ads. You may have noticed before that you are shown ads on Facebook based on previous Google search requests. In our study, we’re looking at a particular kind of personalisation, so called personality targeting. This means that you are shown ads because the advertiser assumes that you have certain personality traits.  
					  In 2017, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714l" target="_blank">researchers from Columbia, Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cambridge</a> found out that personalized ads which are tailored to a user’s personality are a very effective method in marketing. As this type of personalisation is so effective, it can also be misused to manipulate internet users. In order to prevent this manipulation, we think it is important to educate about this type of marketing and to label and explain personality-tailored personalisation transparently.

						As this type of personalisation is so effective, it can also be misused to manipulate internet users. 
						In order to prevent this manipulation, it is important to educate about this type of marketing and to label and explain personalisation transparently. 
						We have come up with a brand and designed advertisements for a fictional product. These advertisements are designed to address specific personality traits. Furthermore, we have conducted interviews with Facebook users to find out which information should be included in explanations and how they should be designed to be understandable. Each ad is equipped  with an individual explanation of why a user sees it. 
						The study does not serve any commercial purpose, which means we do not make money from it. 
						In order to support us in our work, we would appreciate it if you would take part in our questionnaire. You can win one of X $Y Z vouchers by participating.

							<h3>What is psychological Targeting?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Personalisation based on psychological targeting means tailoring advertisements to people's personality traits. E.g. A perfume ad slogan aimed at people high in Neuroticism could be “Safe and sound” whereas the slogan for people with low agreeableness scores sound like “Treat yourself”. 
					Through our so called “digital footprint” it is possible to determine an internet user’s personality traits. Our digital footprint contains information such as browser histories, Facebook likes, posts, pictures & maybe be even messages. Basically everything we do online can be used for our personality profiles. To find out more about psychological targeting,  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Byron_Sharp/publication/326817816_Psychological_targeting/links/5c48478e92851c22a389bcfd/Psychological-targeting.pdf" target="_blank">click here.</a>

							<h3>How do we make assumptions about personality traits?</h3>
					</header>
					<p> Since we do not collect or evaluate any data from Facebook users, we base our assumptions on a study by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714" target="_blank">Kosinki et al. </a>
						The researchers use the database of <a href="https://sites.google.com/michalkosinski.com/mypersonality" target="_blank"> myPersonality.org </a>, which contains data of Facebook users and their Big 5 personality profiles. In doing so, they found out which sites people with certain personality traits like.
						The full list of these "Like" details and their corresponding personality traits can be found <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714" target="_blank">here</a>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We have used this "Like" information to determine which users see what advertisement.
						E.g.: The advertisement, which was tailored to the personality factor "Extraversion", should be shown to people who like sites like "Beerpong", "Socializing" or "Dancing".

								<h2>Our approach to personalisation</h2>
								<p>We can make assumptions about your personality solely on your Facebook page likes.

								Your personality profile is solely based on the pages you have liked on Facebook. Scientific research suggests that liking specific Facebook pages is associated with personality traits, for example, people who are rather extroverted tend to like <strong>Beerpong, Socializing, Dancing</strong>. Apart from the pages you liked, you were also shown these ads because you live in the US, you are female, and between 18 and 35 years old. No other data was used. If you want to know how this works in more detail, <a href="#learn">learn more about it here.</a></p>

								<p>  We do not sell any actual products and have not collected any data about you. Our goal is to inform people about how their data is used online and therefore raise transparency for advertising tailored to individual personality. </p>
								<p>In the future, it is likely that a lot of your personal information, e.g. demographics, how much you are posting, chatting, etc. will be used to compute even more detailed personality profiles. Advertisers can then use this information to show you only ads that probably appeal more to you due to your personality. There are a lot of different approaches to analysing people’s personality based on their online behavior.</p>

							<h2>The 5 Dimensions of Personality&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
						    A Scientific Model</h2>
							<p>In psychology, personality is defined as individual patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. To make assumptions about the personality of users, we use a renowned  scientific model, the so-called Big 5 personality model. This model comprises five broad dimensions: Openness to new experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each person can be described along these five dimensions and scores higher or lower on each of them. Hence, for example, Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, scores rather high in Openness, Extraversion and Conscientiousness. Steve Jobs has particularly high scores in Openness as he is known to be the creative mastermind behind Apple. Moreover, Jobs saved money to travel to India and immerse himself in the study of Zen Buddhism, which indicates an open mind to new experiences and different cultures. On the other hand, Steve Jobs scores rather low in Agreeableness as it is known that “Grown men were reduced to tears by him”. In his work he was always product focus and not people focused (<a href="http://cmi-capital.com/blog/a-big-5-analysis-of-steve-jobs/" target="_blank">Source</a>). 
							The following figure describes these five characteristics and their manifestations in detail.
