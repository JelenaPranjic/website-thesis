								<h2>The Emotional One</h2>
								
								<img alt="icon for trait" class="icon" src="images/emtional.png">
								
								<p>The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive and emotional. They experience emotions quite intensively, which leads to them being sensitive.
									Their sensitivity makes them great empaths. Due to their empathy and depth, they’re very good listeners and observers in everyday life. They’re the ones you can ask for advice and be sure to get a thought through and meaningful one.
									On top of that, they tend to be cautious which leads them to having realistic expectations, most of the time. 
									One of the greatest qualities in people with this personality trait is their strong self-perception, due to their ability to think reflectively.

							  </p>
								
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<p>On the other hand, this also means that they can be particularly self-critical and more prone to stress than the average person. This also leads to more insecurity, they’re often nervous and might seem shy, as they tend to be socially anxious.
								The high sensitivity of <strong>The Emotional One</strong> might make them melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody at times.

								<p>You were classified as “<strong>The Emotional One</strong>” because of your Facebook Likes. This kind of personality assessment is very broad and might not be correct. It is also important to note that each person does not only have one personality trait, but can be described on five traits.&nbsp; &nbsp;

							<h2 style="color: white">The Emotional One</h2>
							<p style="color: white">The Emotional One tends to be rather anxious, impulsive, and emotional. People with this personality trait are prone to empathy and insecurity. 
							People who have this factor strongly developed can be more anxious, impulsive and emotional. This personality factor can also be related to characteristics such as insecurity and empathy. 
								</p>
								<p style="color: white">
							Neurotic people are usually sensitive, which can make them very good listeners and observers in everyday life. 
							Neurotic people can also often seem shy or nervous, because they tend to be socially anxious.
									</p>
								
									<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
							Overall, high scores in "neuroticism" mean that a person tends to be cautious and therefore often has realistic expectations. Neurotic people also have a strong self-perception, due to their great ability to think reflectively. But this also means that neurotics tend to be particularly self-critical and are more prone to stress. The high sensitivity of neurotic people can also mean that they are often melancholic, depressed, irritable and moody.
							But most importantly, because of their depth, neurotic people are ideal listeners to ask for advice.
